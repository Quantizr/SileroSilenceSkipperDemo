# SileroSilenceSkipperDemo
Demonstration of using Silero VAD to accelerate parts of a video where there is no spoken content

Try it: (don't mind the goofy video, was one of the first example mp4 I could find)

Browser extensions like SilenceSkipper, which rely on volume thresholds, cannot detect the difference between music and dialogue. As such, they often slow down for loud music and speed up for quiet talking, the opposite of what we want. Silero VAD is great at identifying when a person is talking, even with music or other noises in the background, making it ideal for watching content where spoken content is most important, for example, lectures or podcasts.
